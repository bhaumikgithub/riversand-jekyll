          The primary objective of RDP is to facilitate relevant, trust, and insights on your data through a Data Continuum solution in <strong>Master Data Management (MDM 2.0)</strong>. Data flows in various forms in exploding volume and velocity from various sources and often is heterogeneous in nature. It can be structured data such as customer data or an unstructured data such as a binary files or stream data. See <a href="#">Data Classification</a>, for more information on how data is classified in RDP. Hence, the objective is to achieve maximum benefits of the volume, velocity, and variety of data to enhance the productivity and efficiency. <strong>Riversand Data Framework</strong> provides the building blocks to handle Data in RDP.

          It includes a set of services in the SDK that interact with each other to provide the required business functionality. Exposed services such as Data Services are RESTful in nature and you can leverage these services along with the Riversand User Interface Framework to build Custom Apps based on your business requirements. See Data Framework Architecture, to learn more about the architecture of RDF.

      <ul class="blue-txt">
          <li>RDF for App Developers: As an App developer, using RDF, you can leverage the RESTful services along with UI Element Catalog from the Riversand User Interface Framework to build Custom Apps based on your business requirements. See RDP for Developers, for more information on step-by-step instruction on how as a developer you can use RDP to create custom Apps.</li>
          <li>RDF for System Integrators: As a System Integrator, using RDF, you can leverage the RESTful services to integrate with the external systems to send data to RDP and export the data from RDP. See RDP for System Integrators</li>
